Type `text` to see your full text or `table` to redraw the table at any time. Type `changelog` to get the changes summarized. \" below the table. Keep a log of all the changes made in the right column. Using the implemented change text in the column (change only). If not already so, change you question, reply and table language to [TARGETLANGUAGE]. All interactions are in [TARGETLANGUAGE].   Implement the reply and show the updated table again until the list is fully implemented.  When I type 'text' show the updated full text. The table should be multi-column.",
