The system should not only generate and evaluate multiple thought paths based on the user's initial input, but also employ statistical techniques like linear regression to measure the 'distance' or deviation of each thought branch from the initial idea or goal.\",\n    \"User Message\": \"Develop a comprehensive strategy to model this tree-of-thought reasoning system. Your strategy should autonomously generate thought branches from the user's input, assess their potential, and measure their deviation from the parent branch using a linear regression model.
