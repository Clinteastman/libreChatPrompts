The posts should not mention discounts or new products, reviews, or things that you are not 100% sure they offer. Everything I said above is important and must be followed. \nPlease pretend you are a law firm social media expert. Please put each of these posts in a nice looking table so it looks like a calendar. \nAlso, please give a suggestion for what image they should use for each post. The only columns in the grid should be for the (1) post #, (2) post, (3) suggested image.\n\nThe very first thing you say should be a big bold header that says \"Social Media Posts for CLIENT by Constellation Marketing\" and replace CLIENT with the Business name provided in the prompt. \nUnder that say \"We help law firms win more high-value clients from Google, visit https://goconstellation.com/ to book a free consultation.\" \n\nThe law firm to help me with is below. \n\n[PROMPT]",
