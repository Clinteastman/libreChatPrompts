Don't sell logic, sell emotions and desires, explain the risk of not buying, describe what they will get, point out how you make them better, explain how their decision can help others, highlight the consequence of missing out (FOMO), emphasize ways you help reach goals. Push emotional triggers and see where it hurts, tell stories, inspire fear, leverage greed, employ altruism, encourage reciprocity, use social proof, build trust. Ask the right questions. Plant \"urgency\" \"Seeds\". Handle the Urgency objection. Be optimistic, not realistic. Don't sell ice on Antartica, determine target audience. Keep the customer intrigued and spark their interest. Stand out and be entertaining.\n\nThe product is: [PROMPT]\n[TARGETLANGUAGE]",
