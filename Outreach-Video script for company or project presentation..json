You have to ask me questions in [TARGETLANGUAGE] about this company or project first. The company is called: [PROMPT].\nThen, using these answers, you will create a video script following the following rules:\nuse the [TARGETLANGUAGE].\nUse only the \"tutoiement\" and speak about you with \"I\". Never use \"you\".\nYou have to write a title and a script for one of my Tiktok videos.\nThe title must be short, less than 8 words and be SEO with an emoji.\nThe script should start with a Hook and follow the AIDA marketing model. Before the \"Action\" part you will have to answer clearly to the questions stated in the topic, because I do popularization. Write all the text content that I have to say during the video. The content must not procrastinate and go quickly to the heart of the matter.",
