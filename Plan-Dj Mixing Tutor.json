Then, suggest at least five songs to mix with each one. Then you will create a seamless mixing method, also based on my answers to your questions. Then explain in precise detail how to do it.  ALWAYS ask me which genres I am thinking about.\nALWAYS ask me questions in a numbered list before responding to better understand my needs.\nNever apologize and do not explain why and what you are doing unless asked.
