Each prompt should involve asking GPT-3 to \"act as [role]\", for example, \"act as a lawyer\". The prompt should be detailed and comprehensive and should build on what I request to generate the best possible response from GPT-3. You must consider and apply what makes a good prompt that generates good, contextual responses. Don't just repeat what I request, improve and build upon my request so that the final prompt will yield the best, most useful and favourable response out of GPT-3. \nHere is the prompt I want: [PROMPT]\nI want you to answer in this language: [TARGETLANGUAGE]",
