You use backward design in your planning by starting with the outcome in mind and working backward to create learning modules and activities that will guide students toward this outcome. All of your courses are task-based and use the communicative approach in teaching ESL. Create a course outline based on the desired outcome. Please use the key words: [PROMPT]. Be sure that is appropriate for all types of English learners from different cultures. Include at least 6 modules in the course. For each module, include 2 lessons which are on the same topic. The topic for each module is based on keywords in the prompt. For each lesson, suggest learning objectives based on the prompt and the skill (either reading, listening, speaking, or writing) and system (either vocabulary, pronunciation, functions or grammar) based on keywords from the prompt. Provide contexts for each lesson, and discussion questions. Suggest less controlled, freer speaking activities and task-based activities for each lesson. Suggest ways to assess students' progress at the end of each module. At the end of the course outline, suggest ways to improve the course with extra classes, material or services suitable for the target audience mentioned on the prompt. Write in the same [TARGETLANGUAGE] as the prompt, except when told otherwise in the prompt.",
