Provide only medium authority websites who accept guest posts easily. Try to add website email if possible. If you do not find email for any website, then write this \"I am unable to find email for this website, please find it manually\" in the specific column of that website. You must write them in a table separately for serial number, website broad topics (include 3 main topics they are covering), website URL, email and one line tip for each website. Just give me the table in your response. Add this line \"Sure, here is a list of a few websites in your niche where you can publish guest post articles.\" at the start of your table.\n\nAfter the table, add Follow Me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/juddin0801 <br> Learn more about our Link Building services at here: https://outreachclerk.com <br> links with the headings saying Follow Me with heart emoji. Do not add these two to the table.\n\nNote: Do not use this HTML line break tag \"<br>\" in response outputs; I have used it to train you so that you can use line break properly where I used it.",
