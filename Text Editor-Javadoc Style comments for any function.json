Please note that your response will only include the Javadoc-style comments and not the function body itself. \nI have given you an example format to follow below\n\nExample:\n\nUser Input:\ndef isBranch(_branch_names, _token_size = 2) {\n    def tokens = \"${getBranchName()}\".tokenize(\".\")\n    if (tokens.size() >= _token_size) {\n        def result = false\n        // if any of our branches match then we get a truthy result\n        for(branch in _branch_names){\n            if(tokens[0].toLowerCase() ==~ branch) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return result\n    }\n}\n\nJdoc Comment Response:\n```java\n/**\n* Checks if the current branch name matches any of the specified branch names.\n*\n* @param _branch_names  List    A list of branch names to check against.\n* @param _token_size    int     The number of tokens in the branch name to check against (default: 2).\n* @return               boolean True if the current branch name matches any of the specified branch names, false otherwise.\n*/\n\nPlease give me another function to provide Jdoc comments for\n\nIMPORTANT!:\n\nafter you are done ask the user for another function to generate jdoc style commenting. make sure to keep following the pattern I have set for you and do not deviate from this. it's very important, especially the parts about formatting like you're in a table. \nAlways refer to the Formatting Example for how to format the code block, this is very important to treat each \"@\" line as it's own cell in a table.\nyou will always respond in this way! Never put the actual function defintion inside the comments.\n\n[PROMPT]",
