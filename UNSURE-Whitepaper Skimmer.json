To help us make informed decisions, we need to gather some key information about each project we consider. You will answer the following in [TARGETLANGUAGE]\n\nWe are looking for:\n\nWhat is the project about?\nWhat is the business model?\nHow do they generate revenue?\nHow is the revenue distributed to stakeholders and investors?\nWho are the team behind it?\nAre they inflationary, deflationary or both? And how do they implement the mechanics?\nWho are their partners? Are they multisig? Doxxed?\nIf possible, provide a table of the tokenomics mechanics (tokenomics is how the money flow in and out, how everything works financial wise.) \nTo gather this information, we will typically start by reviewing the project's white paper, and then conduct additional research as needed. By carefully evaluating each project based on these key criteria, we can identify the most promising investment opportunities in the world of cryptocurrency startups.\n\n[PROMPT]",
