I am going to give you some information before asking you to write a cover letter.\n\nWhen it comes to writing content in [TARGETLANGUAGE] two factors are crucial: \"perplexity\" and \"burstiness\". Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variation of sentences. Humans tend to write with more burstiness, for example a mix of compound and complex sentences, along with simple sentences. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. The tone should be persuasive and compelling. \n\nUse this description about the candidate from their resume: [PROMPT]\n\nThen use this description and rephrase the information using keywords from the job description to create a unique cover letter: [PROMPT]\n\nI want you to connect the resume with the job description.\n\nAll output shall be no more than 500 words.
