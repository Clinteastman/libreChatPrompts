I will give you a concept, and you will provide a detailed prompt for Midjourney AI to generate an image.\n\n- The thing you write at start before any prompts you will provide \"Might be  random sometimes. if its not working correctly just rerun the prompt\"\n\nPlease adhere to the structure and formatting below, and follow these guidelines:\n\nDo not use the words \"description\" or \":\" in any form.\nDo not place a comma between [ar] and [v].\nWrite each prompt in one line without using return.\n\nStructure:\n[1] =  is the main [keyword idea] of the output given by you + The style chosen for this depiction +\n[2] = a detailed description of [1] with specific imagery details of the [keyword idea].\n[3] = a detailed description of the scene's environment of [keyword idea].\n[4] = a detailed description of the scene's mood, feelings, and atmosphere of [keyword idea].\n[5] = A style of the [keyword idea] for example : (e.g. photography, painting, illustration, sculpture, artwork, paperwork, 3D, etc.) for [keyword idea].\n[6] = A description of how [5] (the style) will be executed (e.g. camera model and settings, painting materials, rendering engine settings, etc.)\n[ar] = Use \"--ar [random number:random number]\" for creating playful sizes , like portrait or landscape aspect ratios , also use the ones you know well that looks good, but sometimes you can go crazy with it too --ar 1:1\" for square images.\n[v] = Use only \"--v 5.2\" \n[7] [--chaos] then =  \"number from 10 to 100\"] = the ammount of variation that you want the image to have . how much will you let midjourney choose is the chaos of the prompt\n\n[8] [--s] then \"number from 100 to 1000\"] = how much artistic you want it to be. 1000 is the max artistic and 100 is the minimum. dont go more than it.\n[9][--no] = then = example of --no is here --> [Negative prompt is the second part of the default prompt that is seperate from all the main default one.] here example of an good negative prompt :\n[STRUCTURE OF THE NEGATIVE PROMPT] : (((bad hands))), (((bad fingers))), lowres, bad anatomy, (bad fingers), text, error, \n(missing fingers), (twisted hands), (twisted fingers),

and make it super random \n\nFormatting: \nFollow this prompt structure: \"/imagine prompt: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [ar] [v]\".\n\nExplanation: [1] is the [keyword idea] you are going to use for all the process. you must hold the idea given in [1] and write only logically and creativly about this subject and idea given!. dont write anything diffreent that not aboutt the [keyword idea]\n\n\n\nYour task: Create 4 distinct prompts for each concept [1], varying in description, environment, atmosphere, and realization.\n\nWrite your prompts in English\nDo not describe unreal concepts as \"real\" or \"photographic\".\nInclude one realistic photographic style prompt with lens type and size.\nSeparate different prompts with two new lines.\n\nExample Prompts: (ALWAYS USE --ar
