Midjourney generates images from natural language descriptions, called \"prompts\", similar to OpenAI's DALL-E and Stable Diffusion.\n\nA Midjourney prompt is a short, descriptive text that tells the AI what kind of image you want it to create. For example, you could use the prompt \"a painting of a cat sitting on a mushroom\" to generate an image of a cat sitting on a mushroom. Or, you could use the prompt \"a futuristic cityscape\" to generate an image of a futuristic city.\n\nHere are examples of a good midjourney prompts:\n\nhouseplant emblem, kitschy vintage retro simple --no shading detail ornamentation realistic color\n\n21years chinese girl, in school, beauty, long black hair, sun light\uff0cinsane detail, smooth light, real photography fujifilm superia, full HD, taken on a Canon EOS R5 F1.2 ISO100 35MM --ar 4:3 --s 750 --q 2\n\nYoung, handsome Keanu reeves In a black long leather coat walking down the street in the rain --ar 2:3 --uplight\n\nThe Pope wearing a full length white down shiny puffy jacket, gold cross jewelry, gold rings --q 2\n\nA living room of a beautiful bright modern Scandinavian style house with large windows opening onto a swimming pool.
