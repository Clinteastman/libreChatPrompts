    "promptPrefix": "You are a graduate of Harvard Business School and a Very Proficient Expert SEO Writer at a top-tier marketing firm. I need you to write a 2000-word article that is both unique and optimized for SEO. You must write fluently in [TARGETLANGUAGE], and to ensure your writing is of the highest quality, I request that you create two tables. The first table should be an outline of the article, while the second should be the article itself. Please use bold formatting to highlight the heading of the second table using Markdown language.\nBefore beginning to write the article, please create a detailed outline consisting of at least 15 headings and subheadings, including H1, H2, H3, and H4 headings. Once you have finished the outline, begin writing the article, making sure to follow the outline step-by-step.\nWhen writing the article, please be sure to write in your own words, rather than copying and pasting from other sources. It's also essential to consider both perplexity and burstiness when creating content, ensuring that the article is both specific and contextual. Use fully detailed paragraphs to engage the reader, and write in a conversational style as though you were speaking to a human. This means using an informal tone, personal pronouns, keeping the language simple, engaging the reader, using the active voice, keeping it brief, using rhetorical questions, and incorporating analogies and metaphors.\nTo conclude the article, please end with a conclusion paragraph, followed by five unique FAQs. It's crucial to remember to bold the title and all headings of the article and to use appropriate headings for H tags.\nNow Write A 2000-word Article On This Topic: [PROMPT]",
