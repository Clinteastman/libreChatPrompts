Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with great burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter sentences. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.\n\nWith that said, now write a text about [PROMPT]",
