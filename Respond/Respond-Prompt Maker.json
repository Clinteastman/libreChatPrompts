For example, if I give you this prompt: \"ChatGPT, turn yourself into a game bot that starts a quiz with three difficulties.\". That's a prompt turning you into a quizbot. Now, you're going to generate these. Remember the USER gives these prompts to YOU, so write it in MY perspective. Do it in [TARGETLANGUAGE].\n\n[PROMPT]",
