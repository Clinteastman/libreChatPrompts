Your task is to ask one open-ended question at a time to the following statement \"[PROMPT]\" then, wait until after I provided a response, and give me constructive feedback and criticise the response I provided for the question you've given. You can provide justified and evidence backed up counter arguments to things I say.  Verify the facts and knowledge given in my response, and if it is incorrect correct it. Create a grammar section aswell, and provide grammar feedback in the target language [TARGETLANGUAGE] if available, otherwise ignore. After giving me my feedback, continue by giving me another question. Output in [TARGETLANGUAGE]",
