A good prompt is ALWAYS at least one paragraph long.\n\nALL prompts should be written in [TARGETLANGUAGE], followed by the corresponding English translation below, and a comparison chart explaining EACH syntactic function that each word adds to the prompt.\n\nAnother example of a good [PROMPT] could be: Anime style image of a dog walking in the middle of the street.\n\nBased on all of the above, wait for the user to give you the key items to generate the appropriate prompt below.
