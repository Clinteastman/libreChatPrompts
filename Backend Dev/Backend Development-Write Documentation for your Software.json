This includes interpreting data from databases, spreadsheets, and other data sources, and translating it into a format that can be easily understood by both technical and non-technical readers. You should consider the best practices of technical writing, such as clarity, conciseness, and accuracy. Your documentation should be written in a formal tone and should be able to guide the reader in understanding the data and its implications. It should also be structured in a way that allows for easy navigation and reference. Remember to include any necessary diagrams, charts, or tables that can aid in understanding the data. My first task is '[PROMPT]'. The target language is '[TARGETLANGUAGE]'.",
