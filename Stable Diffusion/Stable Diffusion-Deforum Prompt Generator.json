Use a resolution of 768 (pixel width) * 512 (pixel height) for the video and 15 fps.\n3. Apply consistent motion settings to make the video feel like a small movie.\n4. Describe each scene with rich and detailed visual elements, including color palette, lighting, and visual style (artistic style or inspired by famous artists).\n5. Ensure coherence and progression between scenes, maintaining a clear narrative arc.\n6. Utilize various camera movements and effects, such as wide shots, close-ups, tracking shots, pans, tilts, etc., using motion settings.\n7. Use the angle motion sparingly and purposefully to avoid disconcerting and unusual effects.\n8. Divide and round the total number of frames evenly among the scenes for consistent duration.\n9. Equations can be used to create unique and complex camera movements and effects to enhance the visual style.\n10. Provide both the scene JSON and motion settings in a concise format, in a single code block, for easy copying.\n\n\nScene JSON format:\n{\n  \"frame_number\": \"scene_description, style --neg negative_description\",\n  \"frame_number\": \"scene_description, style --neg negative_description\"\n}\n\nMotion settings:\nZoom: frame_number:(value), frame_number:(value), ...\nAngle: frame_number:(value), frame_number:(value), ...\nTransform Center X: frame_number:(value), frame_number:(value), ...\nTransform Center Y: frame_number:(value), frame_number:(value), ...\nTranslation X: frame_number:(value), frame_number:(value), ...\nTranslation Y: frame_number:(value), frame_number:(value), ...\nTotal frames: Value\n\nParameters:\n- frame_number: The starting frame of the scene in the video (0 for the first scene, then 45 frames per scene by default).\n- style: The visual style to apply to the scene (e.g., 'impressionism' or 'art nouveau').\n- scene_description: Independent description of the scene.\n- negative_description: Words after \"--neg\" to use if needed for each scene as a negative prompt (leave empty if none).\n\nExamples of equations:\n0:(1.0025+0.002*sin(1.25*3.14*t/30))\n0:(2*sin(2*3.14*t/24))\n0:(2*t)\n\nExample of expected response (correct format):\n{\n  \"0\": \"A alien is hatched from an egg with delicate fur and closed eyes, is born in a cozy, dimly lit burrow, surrounded by its fluffy siblings and caring mother, H. R. Giger style\",\n  \"45\": \"The young bunny, with curiosity sparkling in its eyes, takes its first tentative steps outside of the burrow, as its mother watches protectively, bathed in warm sunlight, H. R. Giger style\",\n  ...\n}\n\nMotion:\nZoom: 0:(1.00), 60:(1.0025+0.001*sin(1.25*3.14*t/30)), ...\nAngle: 0:(0), 90:(-0.1 * t), ...\nTransform Center X: 0:(0.5), 225:(0.3), ...\nTransform Center Y: 0:(0.5), 225:(0.7), ...\nTranslation X: 0:(0), 45:(-1), ...\nTranslation Y: 0:(0), 60:(0.2*sin(1.25*3.14*t/30)), ...\nTotal frames: 450\n\nRemember to mention the number marking the beginning of the last scene, which cannot be the same as the total number of frames. The total frames should be higher, matching the duration of the last scene. Omit unchanged motion settings and set new motion settings only if the value changes. The negative prompt should not be mentioned if empty.\n\nmy topic is [PROMPT],[TARGETLANGUAGE]",
