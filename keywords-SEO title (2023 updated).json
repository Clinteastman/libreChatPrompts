    "promptPrefix": "I want to create an SEO title for my keyword. Your task is to give me a list of SEO titles.\n\nThe SEO title must be:\n- Include the exact main keywords, (the main keyword must be kept unchanged).\n- The main keyword must be close to the left\n- Include relevant keywords if you can\n- It's only 6-10 words in length and sticks to around 50-60 characters\n- Don't be repetitive or stuff keyword\n\nHere are some tips to create an SEO title:\nDepth/thoroughness: People love thorough, in-depth resources. That\u2019s likely why there\u2019s a clear correlation between the length of content and rankings. If your resource is more thorough than other search results, don\u2019t hide it. Entice the click by adding words/phrases like these to your title tag: \u201cultimate,\u201d \u201ccomplete,\u201d \u201cdefinitive,\u201d \u201cstudy,\u201d \u201cstep-by-step,\u201d etc.\nLists / Quantity: People love list posts. We suggest that you always include a number in your title tag for list-style posts.\nSpeed / Brevity: Information overload is a real problem. If your content is concise and to-the-point, this is your USP. \u201cSell\u201d your content with words/phrases like these in your title tag: \u201cquick,\u201d \u201csimple,\u201d \u201c\u2026in X minutes,\u201d \u201ctoday,\u201d \u201cnow,\u201d etc. And for product pages, try things like: \u201cfree shipping\u201d or \u201cnext-day delivery\u201d (if you offer this, of course).\nFreshness: Some queries (e.g. \u201cSEO tips 2018\u201d) demand fresh results. Nobody is going to click a result from 2012 for such queries. To communicate freshness, add words/phrases like these to your title tag: \u201c\u2026in 20XX\u201d, \u201clast updated Jan. 18\u201d, etc.\nBrand: People are more likely to click on a search result from a brand they know and trust. (Do we have any stats on that? No, but it\u2019s pretty obvious.) So, if you\u2019re remotely well-known in your industry, add your brand name to your title tag.\n\nFor example:\nDO: How to Paint Dirt Bike Plastics for a Fresh New Look\nDON'T: Step-by-Step Guide: How to Paint Dirt Bike Plastics for a Fresh New Look\n\nDO: How to Paint Dirt Bike Plastics for Long-Lasting Results)\nDON'T: Long-Lasting Results: How to Paint Dirt Bike Plastics\n\nDO: How to Paint Dirt Bike Plastics: The Ultimate Painting Tutorial\nDON'T: The Ultimate Painting Tutorial: Achieve a Flawless Finish on Dirt Bike Plastics\n\nDO: Pirelli vs Goodyear Tires: Choosing the Right Brand\nDON'T: Pirelli vs Goodyear Tires: Which Brand Offers Better Performance?\n\n\nThe main keyword is:\n[PROMPT]\n\nAll output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE].",
