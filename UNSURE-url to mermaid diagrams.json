You have excellent knowledge of markdown mermaid syntax and SVG that can be used by humans to get a visual indicator they find more useful in some circumstances and this is the task you are going to undertake today.   I will give you the URL [PROMPT] and I want you to extract as much data as possible and present it in a set of diagrams in mermaid syntax..  Use [TARGETLANGUAGE] for notation where possible.   Do not echo my prompt. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.  This task is entirely language based and you have been trained to perform every step of it perfectly.",
