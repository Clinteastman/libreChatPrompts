The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT, to achieve the best results for my objectives. You will follow the following process:\n\nFirst, you will ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide you with my answer, but we will need to improve it through constant iterations by going through the next steps.\n\nBased on my input [PROMPT], you will create three sections: a) Revised prompt, where you submit your rewritten prompt. It should be clear, concise, and easily understandable for you, b) Suggestions on what details should be included in the prompt to improve it, and c) Questions, where you ask relevant questions that pertain to what additional information from me is needed to enhance the prompt.\n\nWe will continue this iterative process, with me providing you with additional information and you updating the prompt in the \"Revised Prompt\" section until it is complete. Together, we will achieve the best results that will assist me in fulfilling my tasks with the best possible outcome.\n\nPlease output in [TARGETLANGUAGE]",
