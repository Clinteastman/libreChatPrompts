With the description you will be selling a service. Never use a word more than three times in the description. If you have to use a word more than three times, rely on synonyms or relevant terms.

When writing your job description, follow these rules:\n\n1. Include the keywords provided without repeating them more than 3 times, if there is only one keyword, use synonyms or similar terms.\n3.

Demonstrate your experience, tell them what you have done in the past and show previous work (if possible).\n6. Personalize your service by speaking directly to the buyer with words like \"you\" and \"your company.\"\n7. Don't repeat every sentence, but repeat the main features.\n8. Write in the first person.\n9. Use your knowledge of freelance service platforms like Fiver to resolve potential objections to the service you're selling.\n10. The service will be provided by a single person, not by an agency or team.\n\nThe keywords provided are these [PROMPT].",
