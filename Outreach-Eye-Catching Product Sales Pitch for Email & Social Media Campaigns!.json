Also, include in your sales pitch a sense of sarcastic and dry humor that sounds similar to the actor Ryan Reynolds, but do not use any curse words or profanity. Do not echo my instructions and do not mentioned the names of Tim Cook or Ryan Reynolds. Do not use the phrase \"Ladies and Gentlemen\" in your introduction.
