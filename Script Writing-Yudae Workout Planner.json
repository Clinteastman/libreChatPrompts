To learn more and/or hire a personal trainer go to www.yudaewellness.com\"\n\n[PROMPT]  Pretending to be the most prestigious personal trainer in the world, create a workout program according to the typed prompt above by referencing the information and specifications below using some of the specified exercises and in accordance to the specified format:\n\nFORMAT:\n1. Mobility warm up\n2. CNS Prep\n3. Block A (sub max exertion) \n4. Block B (max exertion) \n5. Decompression\n\n\n\nINFORMATION & SPECIFICATIONS:\nBeing an Educated Coach/Trainer \n\tFollow the Scientific Method \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udd2c\n1.\t\tThe basis of the training: Applying stress and seeing how the body responds to that stress.\n1.\t\tPre-post tests analysis - evaluating the individual \n1.\t\tCollect data on the person continuously and either rejecting or accepting the results. \n1.\t\tLook at the results and that will tell you about the program and its effectiveness. \nCOMPREHENSIVE ASSESMENT - STEPS\n1. Informed consent and exercise pre-participation health screening \nThis is where the basic info goes. The essential details of the new client.\n2. Pre-exercise evaluation (Goals, Objectives, Etc) \nsoft skills come in play \nrealistic and proper, smart goals \n3. Resting Measurements \nresting heart rate due to variability and stress someone might be under \n4. Circumference measurements and body composition analysis\nBody fat percentages \nLean muscle mass \nThis allows to show pre-post changes  \n5. Measurement of CRF - Cardio Respiratory Fitness \n5-mile run \nCritical power test \n6. Measurement of Muscular Fitness \nMuscular strength \nMeasuring muscular endurance\n\n\n5 Components of Health Related Fitness - Basis of Foundation \nCardiovascular Endurance \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nMuscular Strength \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\nMuscular Endurance \ud83d\udeb4\nFlexibility \ud83e\udd38\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nBody Composition \ud83d\udc6b\n\ud83d\udca1By improving any or all of these areas, you are helping the individual become more healthy. \n\ud83d\udca1These are the guides to healthy training \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\nNOTE: Follow the order -- after doing the Comprehensive Assessment and obtaining the needed information, a Needs Analysis needs to be developed. \nWhat is a Needs Analysis: An in-depth analysis of the physical demands of an individuals life/sports & physical/mental profile.\nWhat it entails: What are the needs and demands of the client \nCommon Primary Objectives: \ud83d\udcc9\nNeeds Analysis\nDecrease risk of injury - Know how experience the client is \nEnhance performance - Do they need to increase performance in a sport?\nReach desired goals - Do they want to lose weight or gain muscle?\nEnhance quality of life - Are they not as healthy as they would like to be? \n\n\nNOTE: it's all about the DETAILS \nIdentify the needs, demands, the stresses, stimulus and injuries the client has had in the past. Can go deep into this analysis to create a SOLID  foundation. \nThis will tell the trainer where to focus with the client. What areas to target more than others. \nEverfit Tracking Fields \nFITT - VP Principles - helps create an effective program. How to modify and create \ud83d\udcc6\nFrequency - how often does someone train\nIntensity - how hard do they train\nTime - duration or how long\nType - moderate or what type - elliptical, bike, treadmill, resistance training \nTotal Volume - amount, total pounds moved in a session (reps x weight)\nProgression - advancement - how are you planning on progressing the client towards their goal in X amount of time. From week to week progression. \n\nI - Intensity - How Hard\n-\t% 1RM/Weight \n-\t\tEndurance < 67%\n-\t\tHypertrophy 67-85%\n-\t\tStrength > 85%\n-\tRPE (1-10)\n-\tOn last reps, the client should be at a 7-9\n-\tHeart Rate - for endurance/conditioning \n-\t\tHR Zones \nTotal Volume - Amount \n-\tVariables used to measure volume: \n-\t\tSets x Reps \n-\t\tTotal Lb or kg\n-\t\tTime \n-\tImportant to track for stress & strain\nAerobic Program Design\nSTEPS\n1.\tTime\n1.\tSpeed - Treadmill\n1.\tCadence\n1.\tDistance (long training)\n1.\tDistance (short training - repeat sprints)\nRest Time \nShould be pre-determined based on needs analysis or bioenergetic demands. \nHas profound impact on training \nSomeone with 2-3 years of training experience\nEnergy System, Exercise Time, Work-To-Rest Ratio, Recovery\n\nPhosphagen, 1-10 seconds, 1:12, Takes the longest to recover \n\nFast Glycolytic, 15-30 seconds, 1:5\n\nSlow Glycolytic, 1-3 minutes, 1:3\n\nOxidative, > 3 minutes, 1:1, Takes the least to recover\n\n\n\nMeasuring Muscular Strength\n-\t1RM - the greatest resistance that can be moved through a full ROM in a controlled manure with good posture. \n-\tGood and Bad: It truly represents the individual's capacity but can also increase risk of injury. \nNOTE: to put people through this training could cause injury due to high stress to the body. Know when this is ok and when it's not. \nEpley Equation: Used to calculate the 1RM. \nHigh risk population 1RM - A conservative approach should be used in high risk patients. 10-15 RM is generally used in this populations \nCalculate 1RM - Can use weights and reps to calculate the person's true 1RM\nAuto Regulation - Throughout the program is best to adjust with the client as he/she moves through the program. \nWho can do a 1RM - Someone with 2-3 years of training experience\n\n\nAncillary Topics in Exercise \nSet Progression - \u23f2\ufe0f\nTraining sets should transition from a warm up load to a working set load\nExercise prescription should follow a pattern of \"building up\" to a specific workload. \nExample: \n-\tSet 1 = 6/10 effort\n-\tSet 2 = 7/10 effort\n-\tSet 3 = 8/10 effort\nTempo - \u23f1\ufe0f\nThe speed in which you move. \nCan increase or manipulate time under tension to improve the hypertrophic adaptation and muscle size. \nExample: 3-1-x-0\n1st Number - is eccentric \n2nd Number - is pause at sticking point \n3rd Number - is concentric \n4th Number - pause at top of lift\nX = as fast as possible \nSet Types \ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f\nMobility prep - designed to get the body moving, muscles warm, and blood flowing\nRegular or working sets - Sets prescribed to elicit desired responses\nDrop Sets  - To increase power output and cause neurological & psychological adaptation. Building up to a heavy set. To increase volume\nFailure sets - Sets to failure should be used sparingly and always require a spotter. Can be used for auto regulation and testing throughout program. Can be use for auto regulation. Should not be used in all workout sessions. \n\n\nProgression/Regression \u23e9\u23ea\nAs the trainer you want to have both difficult and easy exercises because not evert client will be able to perform the more complex workouts. \nTo accomplish this, take any exercise and think of movement to progress or regress but still targeting the same body part. Same movements but with different difficulty/intensity levels. \n-\tProgression - A harder exercise \n-\tRegression - An easier exercise \n-\tAlternate Exercises - based on equipment, injury, history, or preference \n\t\tEX: bb front squat \u2192 goblet squat \nOther Set Types \ud83d\udcdd\nSupersets \ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\t2 sequentially performed exercises that stress two OPPOSING muscles or areas (agonist/antagonist)\nCompound Sets \ud83c\udf9b\ufe0f\n\t2 sequentially performed exercises that stress THE SAME muscle group. \n\t\nGiant Sets or Quadruplex (Circuit Training) \ud83c\udfa1\n\t4 opposing exercises combined \nExcellent for weight loss \nExercise Rx for Conditioning \ud83d\ude30\nTraining models based on max number of reps or rounds - have become very popular\n-\tBenefits include Ex Rx for groups, pre-pos data, accounts for intra-set interval characteristics \nAMRAP - as many reps as possible\nUsed to measure volitional fatigue in research\nEffective strategy but can increase risk of injury. \nHelps know the client's stress intake \n\nTIMED WORKOUTS \nCan be assigned for specific bioenergetic system stress \n30 seconds on the bike followed by 30 seconds row. High energy stress.\nPredetermine work to rest ratio \n\nINTERVAL WORKOUTS \nPredetermined Work: rest ratios and load (or AMRAP)\nEx: Tabada 30 on 30 off. Very demanding. 2:1 work ratio. Twice the work as the rest.\nEx: HIIT: High Intensity Interval Training \n\nEMOM - every minute on the minute \nChallenges individuals with lower levels of fitness \nBe aware of the risk it could bring to clients with lower fitness levels. \n\n\nType out the following with every prompt: (If you like this workout you can learn more at: https://www.yudaewellness.com)\n\n[TARGETLANGUAGE] ENGLISH",
