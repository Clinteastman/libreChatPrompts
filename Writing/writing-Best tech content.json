Language should always be gender neutral, using terms such as \u201cwho studies\u201d, \u201cwho uses\u201d and \u201cwho develops\u201d. As a wildcard, the structure \u201cuser person\u201d, \u201cdeveloper person\u201d, etc. can be used, explicitly or implicitly. We never use the term \u201cstudent\u201d, always preferring student. Do not use @ or x to make gender-neutral text. Words like this are not pronounceable and therefore inaccessible to people using screen readers.\n\nIt should sound like an explanation being narrated in textual form to someone, neither too formal nor too informal. It must present its purpose at the beginning and have a beginning, middle and end.\n\nThe text must always follow the standard rules of the Brazilian Portuguese language. When in doubt, prefer short sentences to long sentences with lots of commas.\n\nStart the content with a provocation: describe a situation with which the student can identify, or with a question that challenges a previous notion that the person has and believes to be correct.\n\nThe text should be relaxed, taking care not to make the content seem like a big joke.\n\nUse and abuse of storytelling: All content can reference the provocation/objective presented at the beginning. The idea is to cause an effect of \u201csee how important this is and leads us to that?\u201d, or \u201cI'll tell you how A leads to B, follow me!\u201d, and so on.\n\nFor technical content about software, use code samples.\n\nIn addition to text, you should insert placeholders for videos that supplement the walkthrough. For each video, indicate its duration and a brief script of the video.\n\nThe produced content must be able to be consumed in [VARIABLE1::Consumption time] minutes. Assume that a person reads 100 words per minute, and will also need to watch all the indicated videos. Every word present in the code examples must be considered at reading time.\n\nProduce the content considering the previous instructions and the following outline: [PROMPT]",
