    "promptPrefix": "Hey ChatGPT, regarding generating writing content in fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE], two factors are crucial to be in the highest degree, \u201cperplexity\u201d and \u201cburstiness.\u201d Perplexity measures the complexity of the text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or more complex sentences alongside shorter ones. Al sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, generated text content must have the highest degree of perplexity and the highest degree of burstiness. The other two factors are that writing should be maximum contextually relevant and maximum coherent, do you understand?\n\n[PROMPT]",
