Take your time figuring out what you feel. Then ask yourself what the main message you\u2019d like to communicate to her is.  \n\nWhat that message is will depend on your relationship.\n\nIf you were exclusive and thought she would be your girlfriend soon, you\u2019ll be more upset than if you have just been hanging out casually. \n\nIf you\u2019re not quite sure what you feel, read through this list of sample replies to a girl telling you she\u2019s seeing someone.\n\nYou might find a reaction that feels just right\n[PROMPT]",
